This project is EVM networks indexer solution

It's goal is to be run manually on VM or locally, with indexing blockchains data in one of implemented sources.

It can be think of SQUID SDK for local indexers, but it fetches data manually through Node RPCs.


## Main components

This section describes main components of the project.

### Data access API

For data access you can use:
* HTTP server that provides API for data access.
* WebSockets server for real-time subscriptions.

*Note:* In case using websockets for HFT additional configuration may be needed for MemPool access.

### Indexer

Indexer fetches blockchain data trough Node RPC and stores it in the database.

Default database is PostgreSQL, but later it's planned to support other databases for different use cases.

### Configuration

The idea of this project is to be able to setup local data source for blockchains data easily, by just
specifying all your needs using some configuration file.

You can configure indexer using `config.json` file.

**How to use config file?**

Config file is a JSON with following structure:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "port": "number",
        "host": "string",
        "ws": {
            "port": "number", 
            "host": "string"
        },
        "api_key": "string"
    },
    "pg_storage": {
        "connection_string": "string"
    },
    "network": {
        "name": "string",
        "rpc_url": "string",
        "start_block": "number",
        "end_block": "number", 
        "batch_size": "number",
        "update_frequency": "each_block | once",
        "storages": [
            "string"
        ]
    }
}
```
